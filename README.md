## Introduction

Welcome to the Telecom Network Inventory Management (TNI) project! This repository hosts a powerful Spring Boot web application designed for comprehensive inventory management. The application offers a wide range of features, from basic CRUD operations to advanced functionalities, including CSV conversion and seamless data import and export. Whether you need to manually input data or perform mass loading from Excel spreadsheets, this application simplifies the process and ensures data validation.To accommodate different users, we provide distinct permissions, authorities, and access levels within the application.

Our team is also actively working on implementing an AI and Machine Learning-based duplicate data detection system, integrated with a Flask API for Python code execution. This innovative feature promises to further streamline data management within the Telecom Network Inventory Management system.

## Project Description

The Telecom Network Inventory Management (TNI) project is a comprehensive solution for managing inventory data in the telecommunications industry. This application is designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing network assets, ensuring data accuracy and accessibility. Some key aspects of the project include:

- **Inventory Management:** Effectively manage all telecom network assets, including routers, switches, cables, and more. The application allows for easy data entry and retrieval, ensuring that inventory data is always up-to-date.

- **Duplicate Data Detection:** The project includes an AI and Machine Learning-based system for detecting duplicate data entries. This feature enhances data quality and reduces errors.

- **Access Control:** TNI provides different user roles and permissions to ensure that only authorized personnel can perform certain actions within the application.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on inventory data with ease.

- **CSV Conversion:** Convert inventory data to CSV format for easy sharing and analysis.

- **Excel Data Import/Export:** Seamlessly import and export data to and from Excel spreadsheets, simplifying bulk data management.

- **Data Validation:** The application performs automatic data validation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data being input.

- **AI and Machine Learning Integration:** The upcoming AI and Machine Learning system will enhance data quality by identifying and handling duplicate entries.

## Architecture and Design

TNI is built on a robust architecture that ensures scalability and maintainability. The core components of the architecture include:

- **Spring Boot:** The application is developed using the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development process and provides a solid foundation for building web applications.

- **MVC Architecture:** TNI follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components to improve modularity and maintainability.

- **Flask API:** The AI and Machine Learning-based duplicate data detection system is powered by a Flask API, allowing seamless integration with Python-based algorithms for data analysis.

- **Thymeleaf:** Thymeleaf is used for templating in the application, making it easier to create dynamic web pages and display data.


## Installation and Usage

The Installation:
The requred jar file is now avalable for downlode in the [release](https://github.com/adithya-ag/TNI/releases) section.
once you downlode it, you need to run the jar file using the command "java -jar your-app.jar" so in our case "java -jar intern-telecom-inventory-1.0.0.jar".
Note you have to be in the same folder/directory of that where the jar file is present to run this cmmand in the command prompt. For this eithre use the CD command to go to the requred directoory or after you are in the correct location in your file explorer where the jar file is present, in the path section enter "cmd" and press enter. Then run the above command to start/run the application.
To terminate the app... go to the command prompt where the app is running and press "alt+c" this will terminate the application.

Usage:
you need to go to you're browser and enter the url [http://localhost:8081/tni](http://localhost:8081/tni) to start the application.
for the database and user creation you need to make some changes...soon to be updated.
